JOINING and PLUS seem to be used somewhat interchangeably in the
names. PLUS seems to be the one that would be more consistent with
cuneiform practice.

WITH seems to correspond to ., but in cuneiform we just used
juxtaposition, e.g., SHE HU for our duck, rather than SHE WITH HU.

Besides being called NUMBER, the numeric signs have more hyphens than
they should (NUMBER ONE-N57 should be NUMERIC SIGN ONE N57, like the
provisionally assigned CUNEIFORM NUMERIC SIGN ONE N01).
