<h1>Background</h1>

<p>This is a revised proposal to encode ‘Proto‑Cuneiform’ (ISO 15924
Pcun) characters in Unicode. These characters belong to the earliest
attested writing system, which emerged at the end of the 4th millenium
BCE in Uruk, a region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in what
in commonly referred to as Mesopotamia. Proto‑Cuneiform is a
pictographic script, with symbols etched or pressed onto clay
surfaces. This writing system was used initially for administrative
and accounting purposes. Over time, these pictographs were replaced
with more abstract signs, which are known as ‘cuneiform’. Accordingly,
this ancestral writing system is known as ‘proto‑cuneiform’. The
‘Sumero‑Akkadian Cuneiform’ block in Unicode contains these cuneiform
signs. Apart from the source materials, Proto‑Cuneiform signs are
depicted in scholarly publications, both in tables and in running text
(see ig. ??–??). Currently, these signs are displayed using images or
fonts mapped to other script blocks due to the absence of a Unicode
encoding. The aim of this proposal is to encode in Unicode a
well‑defined repertoire that will enable the representation of
Proto‑Cuneiform characters in plain text.</p>
