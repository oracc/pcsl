      <p>Although the strategically selected subset of the Uruk IV/III
      corpus is only two-thirds of the entire corpus in terms of
      manuscripts, the graphemic coverage provided by the combination
      of ACN and PC25 is very high.</p>
      <p>Of the 7224 texts in the
      entire PCSL corpus, 157 contain
      unencoded signs, i.e., 97.62%
 of texts have
      no unencoded graphemes.</p>
      <p>The total number of instances of graphemes that are included
      in the encoded repertoire is substantial: of
      98055 instances
      of 2040
      graphemes, only 240
      instances of 171
      graphemes are not encoded.  99.76%
 of instances of
      graphemes in PCSL are represented in the encodings either
      directly or as sequences.</p>
