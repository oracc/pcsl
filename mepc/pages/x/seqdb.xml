      <esp:h>Sequences data table</esp:h>

      <p>In column one the character name (CHARNAME) and glyph names
      (GLYFNAME) are given along with the decomposition of the
      ligature into the base characters; in this decomposition the
      different joiners are used rather than mapping them all to '.'.</p>

      <p>In column two the precomposed single ligature character in
      the PUA is shown with its hex code; some ligatures do not have a
      precomposed version, in which case a '0' appears in this
      column.</p>

      <p>In column three the input on the upper row is the Unicode
      character sequence corresponding to the ligature sequence in the
      lower row: if this is working correctly the appearance of the
      upper row of column three should match the precomposed character
      the column two.  Font switching is used to access glyph
      variants.</p>
