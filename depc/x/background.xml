<h1>The Archaic Period in Mesopotamia</h1>

<p>Proto-cuneiform script was invented in the second half of the third
millennium BCE and used until the early part of the second millennium
BCE, approximately 3500-2900 BCE, generally known as the Archaic
Period. This period was extensively described and discussed, with
special reference to texts and writing, by the late Robert K. Englund
in his magisterial book-within-a-book "Texts from the Late Uruk
Period", pages 1-233 in J. Bauer, R.K. Englund and M. Krebernik,
<i>Mesopotamien: Spaturuk-Zeit und Frhudynastische Zeit</i> (Orbis
Biblicus et Orientalis 160/1). Gottingen, 1998, available as an open
access download at https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/151545/.  The
following sketch is based on Englund's discussion to which the reader
is referred for a detailed account.</p>
