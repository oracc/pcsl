    <p>This is a new proposal to encode 1392 ‘Proto‑Cuneiform’
    (\cite{ISO15924} Pcun) characters in Unicode. These characters
    belong to the earliest attested writing system, which emerged at
    the end of the 4th millenium BCE in Uruk, a region between the
    Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in what in commonly referred to as
    Mesopotamia.</p>

    <p>Proto‑Cuneiform is a pictographic script, with symbols etched
    or pressed onto clay surfaces. This writing system was used
    initially for administrative and accounting purposes. Over time,
    these pictographs were replaced with more abstract signs, which
    are known as ‘cuneiform’ (\cite{ISO15924} Xsux). Accordingly, this
    ancestral writing system is known as ‘proto‑cuneiform’. The
    ‘Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform’ and ‘Early Dynastic Cuneiform' blocks
    in Unicode cover most of the Xsux cuneiform repertoire.</p>

    <p>Apart from the source materials, Proto‑Cuneiform signs are
    depicted in scholarly publications, both in tables and in running
    text. Currently, these signs are displayed using images or fonts
    mapped to other script blocks due to the absence of a Unicode
    encoding. The aim of this proposal is to encode in Unicode a
    well‑defined repertoire that will enable the representation of
    Proto‑Cuneiform characters in plain text.</p>
