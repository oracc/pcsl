UŠ~a~v1 for IR₁₁

IB~a~v1 and IB~a~v2 for ŠAB~a

delete F30A3 because duplicate F30C5

delete F30BF because duplicate F2960

delete F30A6 because duplicate F30C6

delete F30C2 because duplicate F30A2

ENKUM/NINKUM sequence or character? EZEN~a×ŠE~a in both


TODAY
=====

ŠEN disunification per CUSAS

@sign ABZU as AB×ZU and ZU.AB; is PC AB×SU/SU.AB rather than ZU.AB, i.e., are SU/ZU not distinguished?

Note that deleting EASL0925 |NINDA₂×GUDU₄|~v2 disunifies the NINDA₂×GUDU₄ variants--is that OK?

implement ~1

PEPC/PC25
=========

PC25 rules: no ZATU numbers above 818--all those are unpublished-mostly-Umma

Sequences:

	The label of a sequence sign may not describe all of its variants
	Movement in the disposition of sequence components underlines the individuality of components
	if X×Y is also a valid description encode as character (UZ~a = MUŠEN×ŠE)
	if a component is a NC glyph-variant, encode as sequence and define a @glyf
	if a component is an unencoded character, encode sequence as character (UTUL~b)
	if a member of a group is encoded as a character, encode the whole group as characters (UTUL~a etc.)


SEQUENCE NOTATIONS AND LIGATURES:

	 ∘ RING OPERATOR means 'signs are in a circle'--e.g., |PA∘IB| means PA is over IB
	 ucun equivalents for ligatures:

	 @ucun renderings
	 
	      . = ZWJ -- no requirement for combined character to exist in font
	      + = 2064 ⁤ INVISIBLE PLUS -- represents true ligature e.g. SAG+GAL2
	      ∘ = 2062 ⁢ INVISIBLE TIMES

	 @uhex renderings
	      . = |
	      + = ⊕ = CIRCLED PLUS
	      ∘ = ⊗ = CIRCLED TIMES
	      IVS => CIRCLED NUM?
	      

@form NAME UNI=USQ PUA=HSQ OID OTF

@glyf NUM UNI PUA OID OTF

@glyf CPD USQ HSQ OID OTF

CPD sets curr glyf name so

@glyf TAG UNI PUA OID OTF

@glyf TAG=GTG UNI=USQ PUA=HSQ OID OTF
@glyf TAG=GRP UNI=USQ PUA=HSQ OID OTF

GTG is a GRAPHETICS tag for tagging variants in a corpus; ~DIGIT
tags should not be used in the corpus because if auto font gen is in
use the ~DIGIT tags can change during font development; GTG must be
constant.

@glyf NE@s (sheshig-form)
@glyf NE@k (kaskal-form)
@glyf NE@p (pap-form)
@glyf NE@g (gunu-form)

GRP is a GRAPHEME to use as the name

@glyf UMUM@s
@glyf |UMUM×PA|

@glyf NAM UNI HEX OID VAR OTF

UNI=>UNI|USQ|UNI=USQ

HEX=>PUA|HSQ|PUA=HSQ

VAR is a constant variant code assignment for NAM and should not
change; it is expressed as a ~ plus a two-hex-digit number; VAR codes
may be out of sequence with respect to the NAM sort order because they
are assigned once and never changed.

.cvNN are sequenced in the font according to the last two digits of
the VAR or using the OTF notation

In ATF XSux the form UMUM~va0 is equivalent to UMUM@s if @glyf UMUM@s
... a0 is in effect; this does not work for Pcun because it conflicts
with existing tags

Sequences DB uses internal format with PUA components and invisible punctuation as descriptors

PC24 has liga disamb F5001 .. F5020 corresponding to ~1 .. ~20


===

ŠE~a in CDLI-gh still not showing in easl etc

===

in mepc/w update the head u and p generation as I revise corpus doco

===

Characters with dotty blobs that should be solid:

Mention diacritic-like characters != clusters

NINDA×GUDU₄ group?

SILA₃×X characters--treat as opaque clusters?

Add missing N58?
