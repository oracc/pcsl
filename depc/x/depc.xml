  This proposal would not have come about without the prior work of
  many people, whom it would be impractical to name exhaustively here
  although most of their names occur \emph{passim} in the References
  section of this document.
  
  The Berlin/UCLA team led by Robert Englund and Peter Damerow, which
  itself gave rise to CDLI \cite{CDLI}, most recently managed by Émilie
  Pagé-Perron and Jacob Dahl and others, carried out foundational work
  on the print and digital resources on which all work on
  Proto-Cuneiform is based.

  Michael Everson, Laura Hawkins and Debbie Anderson carried out and
  fostered work on Proto-Cuneiform for Unicode under the auspices of
  the Script Encoding Initiative
  \cite{L2/16-267,L2/17-157,L2/19-284}. More recently, Anshuman Pandey
  laid the basis for the current proposal in several important
  proposal documents of his own \cite{L2/20-193,L2/22-239,L2/23-190}
  and Robin Leroy was the principal author of a companion proposal to
  this one, Archaic Cuneiform Numerals (ACN) \cite{L2/24-210}.

  Steve Tinney authored the bulk of the current proposal and created
  the Oracc PCSL project \cite{PCSL}, the digital corpus (based on
  CDLI) and resources from which the appendices are derived.

  Robin Leroy authored the section \hyperref[rationale]{``Rationale for
  Separately Encoding Proto-Cuneiform''} and frequently shared his
  expertise on cuneiform, Unicode, and LaTeX.

  The PCSL font was initially created by Anshuman Pandey based on Bob
  Englund's collection of signs and was an essential basis for the
  current proposal. The font was revised and augmented by Steve
  Tinney.

  <xh:h2>Character List</xh:h2>

  <xh:p>The character names follow the general approach used in prior
  Unicode cuneiform character naming. The terms JOINING and PLUS are
  used with distinct semantics: JOINING is used for '+' in sign names;
  PLUS is used to indicate grouping of multiple characters within the
  same container (as in Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform unicode
  names).</xh:p>
