<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This document gives an overview of the Proto-Cuneiform (PC) corpus
and character set.  Based on existing scholarship and published
resources, it also defines some principles for assessing whether a
given character should be considered encodable in Unicode at the
present time.  Applying these principles to the complete
Proto-Cuneiform character set, a proposed encodable repertoire is also
provided.</p>

<p>The complete repertoire is called here the Proto-Cuneiform Sign
List (PCSL). The encodable subset and the associated documentation are
called PC25, for Proto-Cuneiform 2025.</p>

<p>The description and definition of PCSL and PC25 are intertwined,
and we do not attempt to treat them in a separate, linear way. Rather,
the PC corpus is taken as the foundation and criteria are established
for the defining the subcorpus that should be fully represented in
PC25.  Signs that occur <em>only</em> outside of this subcorpus are not
considered encodable, but most of the texts that fall outside of this
subcorpus are in fact fully covered by PC25 because the unencoded
characters affect relatively few texts.</p>

<p>The PC corpus as hosted on the Cuneiform Digitial Library
Initiative website at <esp:link url="https://cdli.earth"/> is the most
important resource for encoding PC because it is defines current
scholarly practice in the field.  PCSL and PC25 diverge from this
corpus systematically only in the translation of the corpus to the
Unicode notations used by Oracc, the <esp:link
url="http://oracc.org/pcsl">Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform
Corpus</esp:link>.  The PCSL corpus makes only minor adjustments to
the CDLI corpus to correct for some minor notational
inconsistencies.</p>

<!--<p>The graphemic repertoire of the corpus is described briefly as
part of the corpus description: this repertoire is fully represented
in PCSL and subsetted for PC25 according to the principles described
later in the document.</p>-->

<p>Another major resource for encoding PC is the set of published sign
lists as well as the collection of signs based on the work of Bob
Englund that is available on the CDLI github repository.  These lists
are described and were systematically treated during the creation of
PCSL.  The individual alignments of sign lists with PCSL are not given
here but are available online.  The individual sign lists are,
however, integrated in the synoptic tabulation of PCSL given in
Appendix C.</p>

<p>The principles as well as an explanatory section on Sequences
provide the rationale for selecting characters that occur in the PC25
subcorpus for encoding.</p>

<p>In Appendices A and B are PC25 code charts and a listing of the
character repertoire.</p>
