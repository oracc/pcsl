At the meeting of the Initiative for Cuneiform Encoding in 2000, it
was determined that “the encoding of proto-cuneiform is initially, but
not neces(s)arily ultimately, beyond the purview of the project
cuneiform encoding” \cite{L2/00-398}. When the principles for encoding
the cuneiform script were set out in \cite{L2/03-162}, the question of
unification with the script of the archaic period was left open.

The initial scope of the encoding covered the cuneiform script as used
from the Ur III period through the first millennium, although a few
distinctions only apparent in the Early Dynastic period, such as {\oraccnoto 𒅎} IM
vs. {\oraccnoto 𒉎} NI₂, and a few characters used only in the Early Dynastic
period, such as {\oraccnoto 𒍡} ZAMₓ(ELLes 396), were also captured in the initial
encoding in Unicode Version 5.0. The scope of the cuneiform script was
expanded two and a half centuries back in time in Unicode Version 8.0
with the addition of the Early Dynastic Cuneiform block, based on the
Early Dynastic IIIa repertoire in \cite{LAK}; see the
proposal \cite{L2/12-208}.

At first glance, it may therefore seem possible to expand the scope of
the cuneiform script further to the fourth millennium. The expansion
of the glyphic range would be minor compared to its current extent;
consider the variety of glyphs for U+1214B {\oraccnoto 𒅋} CUNEIFORM
SIGN IL, from Early Dynastic IIIb {\oraccrsp 𒅋} to Old Babylonian
{\oraccobf 𒅋} and Neo-Assyrian {\oraccnao 𒅋}. Indeed the glyphs of
some proto-cuneiform signs would lie within the glyphic range of some
archaizing Early Dynastic inscriptions: compare the sign LAK500
{\oracclak 𒅋} or {\oracclaksaltiii 𒅋} on the shoulder of the ED IIIb
statue of {\oraccnoto 𒂗𒋾𒅋} \cite{P225850} with the reference glyph
proposed for U+12860 {\oraccpc 𒡠} PROTO-CUNEIFORM SIGN IL.

% NOTE(egg): One would expect Oracc LAK to make for another good
% example here, but it does not have the ED IIIa LAK500, and instead
% uses an OAkk glyph (LAK501=REC314) for 𒅋.
%
% NOTE(sjt): LAK500 is now the glyph for u1214B in Oracc-LAK;
% Ebih-il's IL is u1214B.3 in Oracc-LAK.

This impression of unifiability is reinforced by the treatment of the
Uruk and Jemdet Nasr forms as another column in the
diachronic \cite{LabatMEA}, and the concordances with \cite{LAK} and
multiple Sumerian readings for each sign given
in \cite[167--346]{ATU2}, as in any other cuneiform sign list.

However, a discontinuity in the approach to sign identity in
proto-cuneiform appears in \cite[347\psqq]{ATU2}. Wary of letting a
Sumerian reading based on third millennium texts hide distinctions
specific to the fourth millennium corpus, Englund makes major changes
to the identification of signs, which have been followed in
proto-cuneiform studies since:

1. Switching to a system of opaque sign names without interpretation,
for instance, always GAR for the proposed U+127EF {\oraccpc 𒟯} PROTO-CUNEIFORM
SIGN GAR regardless of context rather than a context-dependent reading
gar (heap), niŋ₂ (thing), or ninda (bread) and interchangeable GAR,
NIŊ₂, or NINDA when referring to the abstract sign for U+120FB {\oraccnoto 𒃻}
CUNEIFORM SIGN GAR.

2. Avoiding sign names based on Sumerian readings of sign sequences,
so that {\oraccpc 𒤤𒨢} is generally transliterated as a sequence, MUŠEN
ŠE\textsubscript{a}, rather than UZ\textsubscript{a}.

3. Classifying allographs, for instance, KAŠ\textsubscript{a} through
KAŠ\textsubscript{d} for variants of signs representing pots, whose
cuneiform reflex is likely U+12049 {\oraccnoto 𒁉} CUNEIFORM SIGN BI
(=KAŠ).

The classification of allographs can reveal semantic contrasts; for
instance, the signs {\oraccpc 𒢅} KAŠ\textsubscript{a} and {\oraccpc 𒢆}
KAŠ\textsubscript{b} appear to correspond to pots containing different
substances, see \cite[168]{Englund1998}, even though the linguistic
distinction is unknown. In other cases, no semantic contrast can be
identified, as between {\oraccpc 𒢆} KAŠ\textsubscript{b} and {\oraccpc 𒢈}
KAŠ\textsubscript{c}. Effectively, from a character encoding
standpoint, this approach to character identity is more akin to the
one used for undeciphered scripts, and is contradictory to the model
for a fully-deciphered script, where orthographic distinctions are
encodable, but stylistic ones are not, even when they are somewhat
systematic.

The avoidance of readings is also incompatible with a unified model,
because it conflicts with the diachronic handling of mergers and
splits. For signs that split in later phases of cuneiform, but have
identical appearances in the early third millennium, such as
{\oraccnoto 𒈩} MES and {\oraccnoto 𒁾} DUB, an interoperable encoding
is obtained based on the reading: a sign read mes is encoded as
U+12229, and a sign read dub is encoded as U+1207E. However, if the
proto-cuneiform approach is followed and the sign is invariably
transliterated as DUB, the resulting encoding may be incompatible with
the one based on a Sumerian reading; see the example of the personal
name {\oraccnoto 𒈩𒇽𒉡𒂠} mes-lu₂-nu-še₃ in Section
\ref{ED I-II Excluded from the Proposal}.

The same holds for the avoidance of readings of sign sequences; an
interoperable encoding of cunei\-form {\oraccnoto 𒉭𒊻𒄷} is achieved by
reading it as nunuz uz\textsuperscript{mušen} “duck eggs”, and
accordingly using the UZ sign, U+122BB {\oraccnoto 𒊻}, whereas
{\oraccnoto 𒑛𒋡𒊺𒄷𒊺} is read as {\oraccnoto 𒑛} sila₃ še mušen niga
“{\oraccnoto 𒑛} sila of barley for fattening the birds”, and thus
encoded using the sequence (U+122BA {\oraccnoto 𒊺}, U+12137
{\oraccnoto 𒄷}). In general, this means that in the cuneiform script,
interoperability is retained regardless of whether a particular diri
(compound sign sequence) is encoded as a sequence, like {\oraccnoto
𒋛𒀀} or {\oraccnoto 𒄷𒋛}, or atomically, like {\oraccnoto 𒊻} or
{\oraccnoto 𒎏}. In contrast, most transliterations of proto-cuneiform
texts involving ducks transliterate them as a sequence, MUŠEN
ŠE\textsubscript{a}. Even ignoring this inconsistency of encoding
between fourth and third millennium texts in a putative unified
encoding, a further problem would arise from the occasional
transliteration that lets itself be influence by a Sumerian reading: a
few transliterations, primarily those of composite lexical texts, use
compound readings such as UZa. If these were encoded as cuneiform, the
composites would then use the atomic signs, and would have an encoding
inconsistent with their witnesses.

Finally, the opaque labels used as sign names, while initially based
on an educated guess at the cuneiform reflex, need to be stable, and
are therefore retained even when they prove to be incorrect as
mappings to cuneiform signs; for instance, the proto-cuneiform sign
{\oraccpc 𒩁} ŠITA\textsubscript{b3} turns out not to be related to
{\oraccnoto 𒋖} ŠITA, but instead to {\oraccnoto 𒔌}
SILAₓ(LAK636) \cite[220]{Wagensonner2016}; proto-cuneiform {\oraccpc
𒡱} KAB is not the ancestor of cuneiform {\oraccnoto 𒆏} KAB, but
instead that of {\oraccnoto 𒄸} ḪUB₂ and {\oraccnoto 𒌇}
TUKU \cite[274]{Wagensonner2016}, a misnomer perhaps attributable to
the second millennium {\oraccnoto 𒆏}–{\oraccnoto 𒄸} merger. The actual
relation between proto-cuneiform and cuneiform signs is often more
complex than a one-to-one mapping; see for
instance \cite[217]{Wagensonner2016} on the development of
proto-cuneiform {\oraccpc 𒡡} IM\textsubscript{a} and {\oraccpc 𒥋} NI₂
into cuneiform {\oraccnoto 𒋼} TE, {\oraccnoto 𒅎} IM, and {\oraccnoto
𒉎} NI₂, or \cite[220]{Wagensonner2016} on the three proto-cuneiform
ancestors of {\oraccnoto 𒔌} LAK636. In many cases, it is still poorly
understood and may remain so.

These structural incompatibilities in the analysis of character
identity, which stem from a now well-established approach to the
fourth millennium texts ultimately motivated by the avoidance of
assumptions about their language, therefore require a disunified
approach.
