      <p>Although the strategically selected subset of the Uruk IV/III
      corpus is only two-thirds of the entire corpus in terms of
      manuscripts, the graphemic coverage provided by the combination
      of ACN and PC25 is very high.</p>
      <p>Of the 6296 texts in the
      entire PCSL corpus, 162 contain
      unencoded signs, i.e., 97.51%
 of texts have
      no unencoded graphemes.</p>
      <p>The total number of instances of graphemes that are included
      in the encoded repertoire is substantial: of
      97838 instances
      of 2036
      graphemes, only 248
      instances of 172
      graphemes are not encoded.  99.75%
 of instances of
      graphemes in PCSL are represented in the encodings either
      directly or as sequences.</p>
