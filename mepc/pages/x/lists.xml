      <p>Prior PC proposals were centred on CDLI-gh, treating it as
      the definitive assemblage of PC signs at the same time as
      recognizing several important considerations: CDLI-gh is not
      100% complete with respect to the PC rcorpus; includes some
      signs from ED duplicates of PC lexical texts; and includes a
      handful of signs which are either duplicates or are apparently
      place-holders from ongoing work on the Schoyen Umma texts that
      was never completed.</p>

      <p>The published sign list of Uruk Lexical Texts from ATU3
      (LLATU) was also utilized as a partial control on
      CDLI-gh. However, three additional lists in a similar format to
      the LLATU lists were not used in prior proposals, leading to an
      inadequate understanding of previously published scholarship on
      the PC repertoire.  Together with LLATU these three previously
      unutilized lists provide a comprehensive new presentation of the
      material covered in ZATU and need to be included as part of the
      foundational data of the PC proposal.</p>

      <p>The four lists and their coverage are:</p>

      <dl>
	<dt>LLATU</dt>
	<dd>Lexical lists from Uruk, but with some extraneous signs or
	forms from ED duplicates, replacing ZATU's coverage of lexical
	lists</dd>
	<dt>ATU5</dt>
	<dd>Administrative texts from Uruk, replacing ATU1 signlist and ZATU</dd>
	<dt>MSVO1</dt>
	<dd>Administative texts from Jemdet Nasr, replacing PI and ZATU</dd>
	<dt>MSVO4</dt>
	<dd>Administrative texs from various proveniences, replacing ZATU</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The sign lists are based on exhaustive scholarly
      reassessments of individual portions of the PC corpus and make
      extensive use of the contrastive notations with subscript
      letters+numbers, e.g., <code>AB<sub>a</sub></code> and
      <code>AB<sub>b</sub></code>.  At the same time, these lists
      gather non-contrastive sign variants under their respective
      parent signs and this is taken into account in PC25.</p>

      <p>The four modern sign lists are an invaluable complement to
      CDLI-gh because they represent the carefully considered subset
      of signs which were vetted for publication whereas CDLI-gh is a
      working collection of signs.  These sign lists make it clear
      that the unmarked variants in CDLI-gh are non-contrastive
      variants as opposed to the contrastive variants marked with
      subscript letter+number sequences.</p>

      <p>Although most of character readings use sign names that
      recall SAC signs, Englund is clear that "until the language
      affinity of the archaic texts is established, these readings
      remain entirely conventional and often serve only mnemonic
      purposes, whereas the meaning of many signs is now quite
      clear" (ATU5 p.19).</p>
      
      <p>Importantly, Englund is explicit in the introduction that the
      reference forms of the signs ("graphemes" in Englund's
      terminology) are only exemplary forms:</p>

      <blockquote>After each sign name a grapheme is presented which
      represents the general form of the sign on the tablets
      cited. This graphic must be understood as merely an orientation
      in understanding the form a particular sign could take, since in
      particular the texts from the earliest stage of writing exhibit,
      to varying degrees, a tolerance of graphemic variation.  (ATU5
      p.107)</blockquote>

      <esp:ssh>Sign List Cautions</esp:ssh>

      <p>Prior versions of a PC proposal have been based on the
      CDLI-gh collection of signs and assume that list entries are
      primary source of Unicode characters.  However, sign lists have
      certain characteristics that can make them unsuitable for using
      to define a character repertoire:</p>

      <ul>

	<li>Sign lists offer one perspective on a repertoire; they are
	not necessarily exhaustive catalogues of every sign in a
	corpus.</li>

	<li>Sign lists often have entries that are convenient for
	descriptive purposes, or for users, but which do not constitue
	a 1:1 correspondence with the Unicode approach to characters.
	<ul>
	  <li>Entries may contain several signs under one
	  heading--this is done in CDLI-gh when the several members
	  given are considered non-contrastive.</li>
	  <li>
	    <p>Entries may combine sequences of signs if the sequence
	    is common or interesting.</p>

	    <p>Sometimes these sequences correspond to later cuneiform
	    sign combinations which have known semantics in
	    Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform (SAC) despite the fact that
	    there is no evidence that the PC sign shares those
	    semantics or is even necessarily an antecedant of the SAC
	    sign in anything but form and structure.</p>
	    
	    <p>Signs are also sometimes grouped into sequences when
	    there is a suspected semantic basis for the grouping, even
	    though the grouping might be considered phrasal rather
	    than being a concatenation of components with specific
	    semantics: examples include the combinations of N57 signs
	    with ideograms where the notation may indicate the age of
	    an animal or some other multiplicative relationship of the
	    number and a commodity.  Thus, |1(N57).AB₂| may mean "a
	    one-year-old cow" and could equally well be notated as
	    1(N57) AB₂--in fact, the corpus instances of such
	    sequences often occur in bothforms.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
        </li>

	<li>Sign forms are abstractions; two-dimensional sketches of a
	three-dimensional writing system which tend to offer typical
	forms. This means that sign lists do not normally capture the
	full range of glyph-variation for any individual character;
	simply because a sign does not have unmarked variants in
	CDLI-gh doesn't mean such variants don't exist.</li>
      </ul>
