<h1>The Archaic Period in Mesopotamia</h1>

<p>Proto-cuneiform script was invented in the second half of the third
millennium BCE and used until the early part of the second millennium
BCE, approximately 3500-2900 BCE, generally known as the Archaic
Period. This period was extensively described and discussed, with
special reference to texts and writing, by the late Robert K. Englund
in his magisterial book-within-a-book “Texts from the Late Uruk
Period" \cite{Englund1998}.  The following sketch is based largely on
Englund's discussion to which the reader is referred for a detailed
account.</p>

<h2>Birth of Cities</h2>

<p>The flourishing of urbanization in southern Mesopotamia during the
fourth millennium BCE gave rise to several major centres of which the
best known and most excavated is that of Uruk.  Major institutional
buildings, new artistic forms illustrating the importance of the ruler
and the relationship of the ruler and the gods, and the invention of
writing are all features of socio-political developments in the first
cities.</p>

<p>Networks of canals connected important centres and the distribution
of material culture and writing show that the world of the Archaic
Uruk period was characterized by significant interaction between
communities, not only within southern Mesopotamia but in ``Uruk
enclaves'' in the Susiana plain of modern Iran and in modern Syria and
Türkiye where Uruk architecture, visual arts, and administrative
systems indicate the presence of Uruk colonies for trading or resource
extraction \cite{Algaze1993,Algaze2005}.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>We cannot write a political history of the late fourth millennium,
and the lack of archaeological context for key Uruk period textual
finds means that we must resort to dating the tablet finds by relative
palegraphical criteria rather than by documented archaeological
findspots.</p>

<p>The sporadic nature of both archaeological excavations and text
corpora is another impediment to a continuous history of these early
periods, as Algaze notes in his excellent synthesis of the Uruk period
primarily from the archaeological perspective \cite{Algaze2013}.
Algaze reviews the surface survey data, excavations, and (in less
detail) the textual finds from all parts of the Uruk world and
presents a coherent picture of a cyclical efflorescence and decline of
major cities in the south each with their own networks of smaller
settlements in a hierarchy up to four levels deep.  In addition, as
mentioned above, there is extensive evidence of relatively far-flung
colonial outcroppings. Considering the extent of these hundreds of
settlements active, albeit often episodically or intermittently, over
five to six hundred years, the text-corpus of less than 7000 documents
from a handful of sites presumably only represents a small subset of
the ancient textual material generated and, in some cases, still
awaiting excavation.</p>

<h2>Major Text Corpora</h2>

<p>Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of the sequence of major
text finds in the `Writing Phase' column. The entry `Clay bullae and
numerical tablets' in the Writing Phase column is the equivalent of
the periodic classification Uruk V.  Only small groups of texts are
omitted from the subsequent Late Uruk (Uruk IV and Uruk III) into the
Jemdet Nasr period (examples include Uqair, Larsa).  For ED I--II we
have the ED I--II Ur texts \cite{Burrows1935,LecompteVerderame2013}; a few
tablets from Uruk which are later than archaic \cite{Green1982}; and
some tablets from Fara that are earlier than ED IIIa
\cite{Krebernik2014}.  Then the record is silent until Fara
(Šuruppak) \cite{Krebernik1998}.</p>

<p>The largest and most important group of archaic texts was excavated
in the city of Uruk. The tablets were found in secondary context,
meaning that the relative dating of tablets to Uruk IV or the later
Uruk III is not based on stratigraphy but on formal and palaeographic
features.  About 100 tablets and bullae are assigned to the Uruk V
period which precedes Uruk IV by an uncertain amount of time.  The
Uruk period text corpus is described in more detail in section
\ref{texts}.</p>

<p>As Englund demonstrates the archaic text corpus reflects
organized agriculture, animal husbandry, and other production. The
documents evidence social hierarchy and specialization, including the
birth of scribal culture in early Mesopotamia.</p>

<h3>Administrative Texts</h3>

<!--
    and some texts can be
understood as inventories of labourers, possibly slaves captured in
military operations
-->

<p>The bulk of the archaic tablets are administrative documents. They
exhibit varying degrees of complexity from simple tags or
one-transaction memos to multi-transactional summaries with a
relatively complex organization of cases as indicated in figures 3 and
4.</p>

<p>A number of studies have analysed subgroups of the administrative
texts, with the result that the content and methodologies of the
archaic accounting records are well understood.</p>

<p>An early example is Margeret Green's work on animal husbandry
\cite{Green1980}, which is complemented by Englund's work on dairy
metrology \cite{Englund1991} and production \cite{Englund1995} and the
herding of pigs and other animals \cite{Englund1995-1}, as well as
J. Cale Johnson's essays on butchering \cite{Johnson2016} and ritual
meat distribution \cite{Johnson2019}.</p>

<p>Other studies have examined grain accounting \cite{Englund2001} and
time designations \cite[XXX]{Englund1988}.  One of the earliest
dossiers of activity of a named individual, Kušim the brewer, is
studied by Peter Damerow and Bob Englund in
\cite{DamerowEnglund1993}.</p>

<p>In another important contribution with far-reaching implications,
Englund also forged new paths in the identification of personal names
of labourers--probably captured slaves--in a small group of tablets
from Uruk and Umma \cite{Englund2009}.</p>

<p>This form of spatial division of the tablets into cases which are
often quite narrow gives rise to an important feature of the writing
of combinations of signs, which may be placed beside, above, or
otherwise near each other as space permits, and may be written in
varying order depending partly on the space available in the box into
which the signs have to fit.</p>

<h3>Lexical Lists</h3>

<p>The other important--but numerically far fewer--group of texts are
the word lists that Assyriologists generally refer to as `Lexical
Texts'.  These appear in the earlist phases of writing and are
especially well evidenced in Uruk III texts. Importantly, many of
these lexical lists continue into the Early Dynastic period, where
manuscripts from Fara and Abu Ṣalabīkh write the same content but in
contemporary cuneiform.  This provides the best evidence for the
alignment of PC and SAC, but an account of these alignments is beyond
the scope of Unicode.</p>

</tex:text>

<p>The disciplinary practice with lexical lists, which are attested
mostly in small fragments containing only a few lines of the text, is
to create composites which allow for an overview of the list and in
which each individual entry is evidenced by one or more manuscripts. A
sample composite is given in the figure above, and examples of lexical
tablets are below.</p>

<h2>Writing Phases</h2>

<p>The precise analysis of writing phases in the Uruk texts is
hampered by the lack of tablet finds in primary archaeological
context. The general assumption is that earlier sign forms are more
curved; have a greater variety of angles; or are drawn with a pointed
stylus rather than being constructed of cuneiform strokes.  Englund's
discussion of this is accompanied by a figure which is unfortunately
absent from the PDF of the book; his Figure 22 is reproduced here..</p>

<h2>Vocabulary</h2>

<p>The language of the archaic corpus is uncertain: many would accept
that it is Sumerian, but for Englund and others this remains
stubbornly unprovable.  Despite this, continuities between PC and
later cuneiform, contextual inferences drawn from counting and
measuring systems, and the similarity of some signs to the objects
they picture all combine to allow the general sense of many signs or
groups of signs to be divined.  Two of Englund's figures are chosen
here to illustrate this point, but the entirety of “Texts from the
Late Uruk Period" is in a sense his demonstration that the archaic
corpus--contrary to what some might think--is increasingly well
understood.</p>
