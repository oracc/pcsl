      <esp:ssh>Historic Lists</esp:ssh>
      <p>The earliest list of Proto-Cuneiform signs is Stephen
      Langdon's {\emph Pictographic Inscriptions from Jemdet Nasr}
      <eb:cite key="PI"/>, a list accompanying the Jemdet Nasr tablets
      published in 1928. Less than ten years later, in 1936, Adam
      Falkenstein published the first list of signs from the archaic
      Uruk texts in ATU <eb:cite key="ATU1"/>.  Falkenstein referenced
      Langdon's list using the abbreviation <code>PI</code>.</p>
      <esp:ssh>The Intended Standard List</esp:ssh>
      <p>The Berlin Uruk projected intended ATU2 <eb:cite key="ATU2"/>, more commonly known as <code>ZATU</code>, to be
      the new standard list.  Published in 1987, the work lists many
      different sign forms for most signs, dividing them into Uruk IV
      and Uruk III, and alphabetizing the entries by the mnemonic sign
      names used within the project.  Entries in ZATU make some use of
      a division into alloforms labeled, e.g., a and b as in the case
      of AB, but use of these divisions is sporadic and the examples
      are subsumed under their head signs.</p>
      <p>However, by the time the list had been prepared, the project
      team had already begun to doubt that the groupings of variant
      sign-forms were an adequate reflection of likely semantic
      distinctions reflected by the sign-forms, as mentioned by Bob
      Englund in that volume (<eb:cite key="ATU2" pp="327f."/>).</p>
      <esp:ssh>Revisionist Lists</esp:ssh>
      <p>Between 1991 and 1996, In a series of publications appearing
      subsequent to <code>ZATU</code>, Englund provided sign lists
      specific to the sub-corpora edited in the volumes which
      essentially replace all previous lists.</p>
      <p>The four lists and their coverage are:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>LLATU</dt>
        <dd><eb:cite key="ATU3"/>: Lexical lists from Uruk, but with some extraneous signs or
	forms from ED duplicates, replacing ZATU's coverage of lexical
	lists</dd>
        <dt>ATU5</dt>
        <dd><eb:cite key="ATU5"/>: Administrative texts from Uruk, replacing ATU1 signlist and ZATU</dd>
        <dt>MSVO1</dt>
        <dd><eb:cite key="MSVO1"/>: Administative texts from Jemdet Nasr, replacing PI and ZATU</dd>
        <dt>MSVO4</dt>
        <dd><eb:cite key="MSVO4"/>: Administrative texs from various proveniences, replacing ZATU</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The sign lists are based on exhaustive scholarly
      reassessments of individual portions of the PC corpus and make
      extensive use of the contrastive notations with subscript
      letters+numbers, e.g., <code>AB<sub>a</sub></code> and
      <code>AB<sub>b</sub></code>.  At the same time, these lists
      gather non-contrastive sign variants under their respective
      parent signs and this is taken into account in PC25.</p>
      <p>Englund's subsequent corpus-edition volumes ATU6 <eb:cite key="ATU6"/> and ATU7 <eb:cite key="ATU7"/>, contain grapheme
      indices without images of the individual signs.</p>
      <esp:ssh>The Digital List</esp:ssh>
      <p>CDLI-gh is not 100% complete with respect to the PC corpus;
      includes some signs from ED duplicates of PC lexical texts; and
      includes a handful of signs which are either duplicates or are
      apparently place-holders from ongoing work on the Schoyen Umma
      texts that was never completed.</p>
      <esp:ssh>The Oracc List</esp:ssh>
      <p>The Oracc project PCSL <eb:cite key="PCSL"/> provides a
      complete, corpus-based sign list comprising the CDLI texts from
      the Uruk V, Uruk IV, and Uruk III periods.  PCSL was created in
      support of assessing previous proposals and eventually preparing
      the current proposal.  It is based on CDLI-gh, and augments that
      collection with additional signs and glyphs from the the
      published sign lists and the text corpus.  PCSL gives
      distribution data for signs in the corpus, an overview of which
      signs occur in the other sign lists, and a proposed repertoire
      for encoding in Unicode.  A succinct presentation of PCSL is
      included as Appendix A of the proposal.</p>
      <esp:ssh>Sign Lists and Prior PC Proposals</esp:ssh>
      <p>Prior PC proposals were centred on CDLI-gh, treating it as
      the definitive assemblage of PC signs at the same time as
      recognizing several important considerations: </p>
      <p>The published sign list of Uruk Lexical Texts from ATU3
      (LLATU) was also utilized as a partial control on
      CDLI-gh. However, three additional lists in a similar format to
      the LLATU lists were not used in prior proposals, leading to an
      inadequate understanding of previously published scholarship on
      the PC repertoire.  Together with LLATU these three previously
      unutilized lists provide a comprehensive new presentation of the
      material covered in ZATU and need to be included as part of the
      foundational data of the PC proposal.</p>
      <p>The four modern sign lists are an invaluable complement to
      CDLI-gh because they represent the carefully considered subset
      of signs which were vetted for publication whereas CDLI-gh is a
      working collection of signs.  These sign lists make it clear
      that the unmarked variants in CDLI-gh are non-contrastive
      variants as opposed to the contrastive variants marked with
      subscript letter+number sequences.</p>
      <esp:ssh>Sign List Cautions</esp:ssh>
      <p>Sign lists have certain characteristics that can make them
      unsuitable for using to define a character repertoire:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign lists offer one perspective on a repertoire; they are
	not necessarily exhaustive catalogues of every sign in a
	corpus.</li>
        <li>Sign lists often have entries that are convenient for
	descriptive purposes, or for users, but which do not constitute
	a 1:1 correspondence with the Unicode approach to characters.
	<ul><li>Entries may contain several signs under one
	  heading--this is done in CDLI-gh when the several members
	  given are considered non-contrastive.</li><li><p>Entries may combine sequences of signs if the sequence
	    is common or interesting.</p><p>Sometimes these sequences correspond to later cuneiform
	    sign combinations which have known semantics in
	    Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform (SAC) despite the fact that
	    there is no evidence that the PC sign shares those
	    semantics or is even necessarily an antecedant of the SAC
	    sign in anything but form and structure.</p><p>Signs are also sometimes grouped into sequences when
	    there is a suspected semantic basis for the grouping, even
	    though the grouping might be considered phrasal rather
	    than being a concatenation of components with specific
	    semantics: examples include the combinations of N57 signs
	    with ideograms where the notation may indicate the age of
	    an animal or some other multiplicative relationship of the
	    number and a commodity.  Thus, |1(N57).AB₂| may mean "a
	    one-year-old cow" and could equally well be notated as
	    1(N57) AB₂--in fact, the corpus instances of such
	    sequences often occur in bothforms.</p></li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sign forms are abstractions; two-dimensional sketches of a
	three-dimensional writing system which tend to offer typical
	forms. This means that sign lists do not normally capture the
	full range of glyph-variation for any individual character;
	simply because a sign does not have unmarked variants in
	CDLI-gh doesn't mean such variants don't exist.</li>
        <li>Although most of character readings use sign names that
	recall SAC signs, Englund is clear that "until the language
	affinity of the archaic texts is established, these readings
	remain entirely conventional and often serve only mnemonic
	purposes, whereas the meaning of many signs is now quite
	clear" (ATU5 p.19).</li>
        <li>Importantly, Englund is explicit in the introduction that
	the reference forms of the signs (``graphemes'' in Englund's
	terminology) are only exemplary forms:</li>
        <blockquote>After each sign name a grapheme is presented which
	represents the general form of the sign on the tablets
	cited. This graphic must be understood as merely an orientation
	in understanding the form a particular sign could take, since in
	particular the texts from the earliest stage of writing exhibit,
	to varying degrees, a tolerance of graphemic variation.  (ATU5
	p.107)</blockquote>
