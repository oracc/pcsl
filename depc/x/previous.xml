  <h1>Previous Proposals</h1>

  <p>This proposal supersedes the following documents:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>L2/16‑267: “Preliminary proposal to encode Proto‑Cuneiform in the SMP” (Everson &amp; Hawkins)</li>
    <li>L2/17‑157: “Proposal to encode Proto‑Cuneiform in the SMP of the UCS” (Everson &amp; Hawkins)</li>
    <li>L2/19‑284: “Proposal to Encode Proto‑Cuneiform in the SMP of the UCS” (Hawkins)</li>
    <li>L2/20‑193: “Preliminary proposal to encode Proto‑Cuneiform in Unicode” (Pandey)</li>
    <li>L2/22‑239: “Revised proposal to encode Proto‑Cuneiform in Unicode” (Pandey)</li>
    <li>L2/23‑190: “Revised proposal to encode Proto‑Cuneiform in Unicode” (Pandey)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This revision supercedes recommendations made by Stephen Tinney in the following document related to
  the composition of the scholarly and Unicode repertoires:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>L2/24‑211: “Comments on L2/23‑190 Revised proposal to encode Proto‑Cuneiform in Unicode”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Most numerical signs have been moved to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>L2/24‑210: “Archaic Cuneiform Numerals” (Leroy)</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Major changes and enhancements from the previous proposal (L2/23‑190) include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A revised set of principles on which the encoding is based</li>
  <li>Alignment of the encoding with established disciplinary
  practices</li>
  <li>Use of all available published and digital data for
  Proto-Cuneiform rather than sole reliance on the CDLI-gh collection
  of sign images</li>
  <li>Several hundred previously encoded characters are treated as
  non-contrastive variants, following disciplinary standards, and are
  not encoded separately</li>
  <li>Over two hundred previously encoded characters are treated as
  sequences and are not encoded separately.</li>
</ul>
