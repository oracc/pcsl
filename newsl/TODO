UŠ~a~v1 for IR₁₁

IB~a~v1 and IB~a~v2 for ŠAB~a

delete F30A3 because duplicate F30C5

delete F30BF because duplicate F2960

delete F30A6 because duplicate F30C6

ENKUM/NINKUM sequence or character? EZEN~a×ŠE~a in both


TODAY
=====

ŠEN disunification per CUSAS

@sign ABZU as AB×ZU and ZU.AB; is PC AB×SU/SU.AB rather than ZU.AB, i.e., are SU/ZU not distinguished?

Note that deleting EASL0925 |NINDA₂×GUDU₄|~v2 disunifies the NINDA₂×GUDU₄ variants--is that OK?

implement ~1

PEPC/PC25
=========

PC25 rules: no ZATU numbers above 818--all those are unpublished-mostly-Umma

Sequences:

	The label of a sequence sign may not describe all of its variants
	if X×Y is also a valid description encode as character (UZ~a = MUŠEN×ŠE)
	if a component is a NC glyph-variant, encode as sequence and define a @glyf
	if a component is an unencoded character, encode sequence as character (UTUL~b)
	if a member of a group is encoded as a character, encode the whole group as characters (UTUL~a etc.)
