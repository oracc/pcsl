      <p>This page provides SJT's answers to the AP questions asked in
      <esp:link url="/pcsl/downloads/ap24-questions.pdf">the
      2024-10-05 draft PC proposal</esp:link>.  This page is
      transient; it will be removed when all the issues are
      resolved.</p>

      <esp:h>Common Points</esp:h>

      <esp:sh>Existing Naming Practice versus PCSL</esp:sh>

      <p>It's sometimes not clear whether it's worth renaming a sign
      from the CDLI-gh form to a novel PCSL form--we have done that
      quite a lot, but there is still some value to being selective
      about when to rename.  In the answers if I feel a call is more
      or less 50-50 I've recommended sticking to the CDLI-gh
      practice.</p>
      
      <esp:sh>Sequences</esp:sh>

      <p>There are several kinds of "sign" which we should treat as
      sequences rather than encoding them as independent codepoints:</p>

      <dl>
	<dt>BESIDE compositions</dt>
	<dd>Signs that are simple juxtapositions should not be assigned codepoints.</dd>
	<dt>"DAY" compositions</dt>
	<dd>The signs composed of UDÃ—N followed by another number, M,
	should not be assigned codepoints.</dd>
	<dd>"AGE" compositions</dd>
	<dt>Combinations of N57 followed by an ideogram should not be
	assigned codepoints.</dt>
      </dl>

	<!--1--><li>The removed signs are either Uruk V (very, very
	     few) or Early Dynastice I/II (the majority).  Most of the
	     ED I/II are from Ur--I can provide lists of each in the
	     course of this phase of work, and I am also going to
	     double-check the Uruk IV/III vs ED I/II repertoires.</li>
	
	<!--2--><li>From the description it sounds like the Unicode
	     and PCSL orders are closely aligned; let's see how that
	     looks when we have a "finished" proposal and see how to
	     tweak the orders if necessary.  I agree that in this case
	     we might as well align the sort orders as closely as
	     possible.</li>

	<!--3--><li>There is very little standardization of practice
	     in scholarly use of the <i>tenu</i> designation; I would
	     recommend keeping existing naming practices where we can
	     as a general approach. In the case in point, if I were to
	     change the names, I would think of AD~a as a tenu form of
	     AD~b not vice-versa (because tenu means "slanting" and
	     AD~b is horizontal but AD~a is turned). That would be a
	     double-renaming, so for practical purposes it would be
	     easier to accept that the practice of marking with
	     <code>~</code>-allographs versus labeling as
	     <code>@t</code> is inconsistent.</li>

	<!--4--><li>We should definitely have @compoundonly entries in
	     PCSL for these--I have probably already done this because
	     the Oracc sign list tool (sx) requires all compound
	     components to be declared either as @sign or
	     @compoundonly.  As the proposal goes along in the next
	     few weeks I will keep the @compoundonly updated.</li>

	<!--5--><li>I will keep this question front-of-mind as I
	     process the new signs in CUSAS, but in general there are
	     not new designations.</li>

	<!--6--><li>We should definitely rename AN~v2 to AN~v1,
	     yes. For AN~a, I think the differences are so neglible
	     that it is not worth retaining as an allograph.  We could
	     keep it in the font as a SALT alternative if you don't
	     want it to be lost forever.</li>

	<!--7--><li>Yes, we can rename to |(BU~a%BU~a).NA2~a|.</li>

	<!--8--><li>Yes, by all means rename to
	     |(BU~a~v1%BU~a~v1).NA2~b@n|; the ó²±£ form is nicer as you
	     say.</li>

	<!--9--><li>Yes, we can rename to |DARAâ‚ƒ~c1Ã—(KARâ‚‚~c.Å E~a)|.</li>

	<!--10--><li>Yes, rename to |DUG~aÃ—LAM~b~v1|.</li>

	<!--11--><li>Yes, rename to DUG~c~v1@t.</li>

	<!--12--><li>Yes, rename to DUG~c~v3@t</li>

	<!--13--><li>If you want to capture all of the variation in
	     "|EN~c&amp;EN~c|", how about |EN~f&amp;EN~f@180| with
	     Unicode name EN-F OVER EN-F INVERTED or the like?</li>

	<!--14--><li>I'm OK with |EZEN~aÃ—(HIÃ—1(N57)&amp;AN)|; I think
	     the wrapper groupings on |(HIÃ—1(N57)).(HIÃ—1(N57))| is a
	     CDLI legacy--it's not needed for PCSL; we should use the
	     simpler |HIÃ—1(N57).HIÃ—1(N57)|.</li>

	<!--15--><li>TODO</li>

	<!--16--><li>TODO</li>

	<!--17--><li>TODO</li>

	<!--18--><li>Yes, correct; the ~v1 should apply only to the
	     ZATU753: |GA~a~v1.ZATU753~v1|.  Both variants should be
	     sequences, though.</li>

	<!--19--><li>I don't think we should rename the GAN~b sequence
	     to align with the DUG sequence; the labels don't
	     currently have consistent structural implications and
	     things are already complex enough, so I would avoid
	     adding another layer of complexity.</li>

	<!--20--><li>Yes, rename to |GAN~c~v1Ã—LAGAB~b|.</li>

	<!--21--><li>Yes, rename to |GAN~c~v1Ã—SIGâ‚‡|.</li>

	<!--22--><li>The differences are in both components so I think
	     it is simplest to treat the combinations as variants and
	     keep |(GIÅ Ã—(DIN.DIN))~[abc]| as they are.</li>

	<!--23--><li>Yes, |GIÅ ~v1Ã—Å Uâ‚‚~b| is preferable.</li>

	<!--24--><li>CDLI-gh does have |LAGAB~axKUSZU2~b| for this so I
	     suggest we use that rather than create a new
	     allograph.</li>

	<!--25--><li>In TURâ‚ƒ~a ð’¯˜ and TURâ‚ƒ~b ð’¯š the differentiation is
	     the end of NUN which is forked and has a final vertical
	     in TURâ‚ƒ~a and plain in TURâ‚ƒ~b.  We should leave
	     |LAGAB~aÃ—NUN~b| as is because it has a plain ending.</li>

	<!--26--><li>LAM is quite a variable sign--I'm OK with adding
	     LAM~b~v3 for ð’¦® as LAM~b~v@r.</li>

	<!--27--><li>Yes, rename to LAM~b~v1@s.</li>

	<!--28--><li>It's interesting that CDLI-gh has GESZTU~c3 and
	     GESZTU~c5 but not the intervening ones. We can
	     appropriate GEÅ TU~c1, GEÅ TU~c2, to give us |LUâ‚‚Ã—GEÅ TU~c1|
	     and |SAG~v1Ã—GEÅ TU~c2|, and I will document it in
	     PCSL. Let's leave |SAGÃ—GEÅ TU~a| as it is, because the
	     GEÅ TU form in that compound is essentially GEÅ TU~a.</li>

	<!--29--><li>Yes, this should be MAR@g!</li>

	<!--30--><li>Sequence</li>

	<!--31--><li>Sequence</li>

	<!--32--><li>We should leave this as it is because it aligns
	     with the ACN-encoded |NINDAâ‚‚Ã—(Å E.2(N01))| and the form of
	     2(N01) is the one that is standard in this compound.</li>

	<!--33--><li>Yes, the PCSL names and the Unicode names should
	     only have the non-GUDUâ‚„ versions because GUDUâ‚„ is a
	     semantic interpretation and we should be avoiding those
	     where possible.  I will keep them in PCSL with the @aka
	     tag; I would leave it up to you whether there there is an
	     annotation in the Unicode names list.</li>

	<!--34--><li>Follow your preference here.</li>

	<!--35--><li>Because 'tenu' is really 'slanted', but is used
	     liberally, I would not consider ð’¨• as NAB@t. I
	     definitely recognize that @t is sometimes used in this
	     way.</li>

	<!--36--><li>I think the gestalt of the two SAG ð’ª© and ð’ªª is
	     similar enough to leave this as it is.</li>

	<!--37--><li>Yes, it should be SAG~v1 ð’ª® (in your question you
	     have SAG@g ð’ª« but I assume that is a typo).</li>

	<!--38--><li>We have two SAGÃ—GEÅ TU~b: the nutillu ð’ª­
	     |SAG@nÃ—GEÅ TU~b| and the regular ð’ª³ |SAG~v2Ã—GEÅ TU~b|. The
	     glyphs in the question don't align with this but I think
	     the names and glyphs are correct in AP24; am I missing
	     something?</li>

	<!--39--><li>Yes, |SAL.LAM~b~v1|; sequence.</li>

	<!--40--><li>I would suggest renaming |SILAâ‚ƒ~aÃ—DUG~a|~v1 to
	     |SILAâ‚ƒ~a~v1Ã—DUG~a| giving us a compoundonly
	     SILAâ‚ƒ~a~v1 which has a circular end.</li>

	<!--41--><li>Yes, this should be |GARAâ‚‚~aÃ—SILAâ‚ƒ~a|.</li>

	<!--42--><li>I think we can leave ZATU646 as is, the
	     difference is so slight.</li>

	<!--43--><li>CDLI-gh has |SILA3~dxNI~a| so let's rename to |SILAâ‚ƒ~dÃ—NI~a|.</li>
