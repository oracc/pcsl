\par This project is based on the CDLI corpus of Proto-Cuneiform
      texts from the Uruk IV and III periods. It also hosts a
      signlist which is based on several sources: the \Ha{https://github.com/cdli-gh/proto-cuneiform_signs}{CDLI
      proto-cuneiform signs GitHub repository}; Anshuman
      Pandey's \Ha{https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23190-proto-cuneiform.pdf}{Revised
      proposal to encode Proto-Cuneiform in Unicode}; and
      revisions and additions by Steve Tinney.

\Hh{}Proto-Cuneiform Sign List

\bgroup\imageinline{}\includegraphics{/home/stinney/orc/easl/pcsl/images/}\egroup

\par PCSL, the Proto-Cuneiform Sign List, combines a complete
      corpus-based sign list of the CDLI Proto-Cuneiform corpus with
      an inventory of Proto-Cuneiform signs derived from several
      sources.


\par You can browse the signlist \Ha{/pcsl/signlist}{here}

\Hhhh{}PCSL File Format


\par PCSL is maintained in the Oracc ASL format as defined for
      \Ha{https://build-oracc.museum.upenn.edu/osl/asloslfileformat/}{the
      Oracc Sign List}.

\Hhhh{}PCSL Architecture


\par PCSL makes extensive use of the \code{\example{}∼} (tilde) modifiers to denote subforms of
      signs, and the data architecture separates base signs from
      tilde-modified signs by using \code{\example{}@sign}
      only for base signs (those stripped of all tilde-modified
      components) and \code{\example{}@form} only for
      tilde-modified signs.


\par By rule, if a \code{\example{}@sign} has child
      \code{\example{}@form}s that with
      tilde-modifications, then the parent sign is mapped to the child
      with the \code{\example{}∼a} modifier.


\par Compound signs are gathered under a parent sign which is
      formed of the unmodified bases; thus, \code{\cookbook{}|DUG∼b×KUR∼a|} has a parent sign \code{\cookbook{}|DUG×KUR|}, with a form \code{\cookbook{}|DUG∼b×KUR∼a|}. Because the parent-child
      relationship can be complex, compound sign parents are not by
      default mapped to a specific child form.  Instead, if a compound
      parent occurs in the corpus the corresponding form can be
      identified by collation and mapped as necessary.  If multiple
      occurrences of a parent compound are found in the corpus with
      differening child form correspondences, the corpus must be fixed
      to resolve the ambiguity.

\Hh{}Encoding Proto-Cuneiform


\par Like Gaul, PCSL's resources for encoding Proto-Cuneiform are divided into three parts:

\Hdl\Hdt{}MEPC: Materials for Encoding Proto-Cuneiform

{}Basic data and secondary materials related to the text corpus, graphemics, and sign lists.

\Hdt{}PEPC: Principles for Encoding Proto-Cuneiform

{}A set of principles for assessing the encodability of signs and sign list entries.

\Hdt{}PC25: Proto-Cuneiform 2025

{}A proposed initial encoding for Proto-Cuneiform.

\Henddl
\Hh{}Materials for Encoding Proto-Cuneiform


\par Like PCSL's resources for encoding Proto-Cuneiform, MEPC is divided into three parts:

\Hdl\Hdt{}Corpus

{}An overview of the PC text corpus and how its subset used for PC25.

\Hdt{}Graphemes

{}Data on the distribution of graphemes in the corpus and subcorpora.

\Hdt{}Sign Lists

{}Top-level sign lists for PCSL and PC25 derived from a
	combination of the text corpus and extant sign lists.

\Henddl
\Hh{}Corpus


\par The PC text Corpus is defined by the CDLI corpus of
      Proto-Cuneiform texts of Uruk IV and Uruk III data, as adapted
      for use by PCSL: we call this \code{{}CDLI-tc}; note that
      CDLI-tc is used here only in the PCSL version of the
      corpus. This version has some minor modifications to the
      transliteration and has been converted to use Unicode
      transliteration conventions rather than the CDLI ASCII ones.


\par There are 5976 texts in the corpus of which 1752 are
      attributed to Uruk IV and 4224, or roughly 75⁒ of the corpus, to
      the subsequent Uruk III period.

\Hhhh{}The Digital Corpus


\par The digital corpus includes the contents of the following major publications:

\Hul\Hli{}Uruk lexical tablets from ATU3 (Uruk IV and Uruk III)

\Hli{}Uruk administrative tablets from ATU5, ATU6, ATU7 (Uruk IV and Uruk III);
	these supercede ATU1

\Hli{}Jemdet Nasr (Uruk III) tablets from MSVO1; these supercede
	Langdon, PI

\Hli{}Tablets from various locations from MSVO4; this includes
	non-Uruk tablets which were included in ATU1

\Hli{}Tablets in private collections from various locations in
	CUSAS1, CUSAS21, and CUSAS31; these post-date the ATU and MSVO
	volumes

\Hli{}Tablets from the "Erlenmeyer Collection"; these were to be
	published in MSVO3 which has not yet appeared; many of them
	have been edited by Englund and others in various
	publications, however

\Hendul
\Hhhh{}PCSL Corpus


\par PCSL's version of CDLI-tc has the following composition
      divided by provenience, period, and published/unpublished
      status:

\Hhhh{}PC25 Corpus


\par About 1/3 of the PCSL corpus is available only in
      transliteration or photograph and has not yet been subjected to
      the rigorous assessment of a scholarly edition. These texts are
      removed to create a subcorpus of well-studied text to serve as
      the basis for the initial (and largest) phase of encoding of
      Proto-Cuneiform.


\par The subsetting is based on the CDLI catalogue entries as of
      February 2025.  It is possible that features of the CDLI data
      may mean that a few texts that should have been omitted are
      included in the PC25 corpus and vice versa. The impact of this
      on the final repertoire is neglible, however, because of the
      cross-checking between corpus and published sign lists.


\par PC25's subset of the PCSL corpus has the following
      composition divided by provenience, period, and
      published/unpublished status:

\Hh{}Sign Lists


\par Prior PC proposals were centred on CDLI-gh, treating it as
      the definitive assemblage of PC signs at the same time as
      recognizing several important considerations: CDLI-gh is not
      100⁒ complete with respect to the PC rcorpus; includes some
      signs from ED duplicates of PC lexical texts; and includes a
      handful of signs which are either duplicates or are apparently
      place-holders from ongoing work on the Schoyen Umma texts that
      was never completed.


\par The published sign list of Uruk Lexical Texts from ATU3
      (LLATU) was also utilized as a partial control on
      CDLI-gh. However, three additional lists in a similar format to
      the LLATU lists were not used in prior proposals, leading to an
      inadequate understanding of previously published scholarship on
      the PC repertoire.  Together with LLATU these three previously
      unutilized lists provide a comprehensive new presentation of the
      material covered in ZATU and need to be included as part of the
      foundational data of the PC proposal.


\par The four lists and their coverage are:

\Hdl\Hdt{}LLATU

{}Lexical lists from Uruk, but with some extraneous signs or
	forms from ED duplicates, replacing ZATU's coverage of lexical
	lists

\Hdt{}ATU5

{}Administrative texts from Uruk, replacing ATU1 signlist and ZATU

\Hdt{}MSVO1

{}Administative texts from Jemdet Nasr, replacing PI and ZATU

\Hdt{}MVSVO4

{}Administrative texs from various proveniences, replacing ZATU

\Henddl

\par The sign lists are based on exhaustive scholarly
      reassessments of individual portions of the PC corpus and make
      extensive use of the contrastive notations with subscript
      letters+numbers, e.g., \code{{}AB\Hsub{a}} and
      \code{{}AB\Hsub{b}}.  At the same time, these lists
      gather non-contrastive sign variants under their respective
      parent signs and this is taken into account in PC25.


\par The four modern sign lists are an invaluable complement to
      CDLI-gh because they represent the carefully considered subset
      of signs which were vetted for publication whereas CDLI-gh is a
      working collection of signs.  These sign lists make it clear
      that the unmarked variants in CDLI-gh are non-contrastive
      variants as opposed to the contrastive variants marked with
      subscript letter+number sequences.


\par Importantly, Englund is explicit in the introduction that the
      reference forms of the signs ("graphemes" in Englund's
      terminology) are only exemplary forms:

\begin{quote}After each sign name a grapheme is presented which
      represents the general form of the sign on the tablets
      cited. This graphic must be understood as merely an orientation
      in understanding the form a particular sign could take, since in
      particular the texts from the earliest stage of writing exhibit,
      to varying degrees, a tolerance of graphemic variation.  (ATU5
      p.107)

\Hh{}Revised Principles for Encoding Proto-Cuneiform


\par This page reviews some of the previous assumptions and
      challenges surrounding a PC encoding and lays out a revised set
      of principles on which the PC25 repertoire is based.

\Hhh{}Background

\Hhhh{}Issues with Sign Lists

\Hul\Hli{}Proposals so far based on lists, especially CDLI-gh and
	assume list entries are primary source of Unicode
	characters

\Hli{}Sign Lists offer one perspective on a repertoire

\Hli{}Can't assume that every sign list entry should be encoded

\Hli{}Sign forms are abstractions; two-dimensional sketches of a
	three-dimensional writing system which tend to offer typical
	forms

\Hli{}Sign Lists do not define the use of signs in a corpus

\Hli{}Sign Lists do not necessarily capture the full range of
	glyph-variation for any individual character; just because a
	sign doesn't have unmarked variants in CDLI-gh doesn't mean
	such variants don't exist (Uruk IV EZEN∼c)

\Hendul
\Hhhh{}Constrastive Usage

\Hul\Hli{}Prior assumption that we cannot identify any
	contrastive/non-contrastive distinctions is not valid

\Hli{}Historical dimension--Uruk IV and Uruk III forms of same sign
	(sometimes not a clear distinction)

\Hli{}Lexical Data -- Uruk IV vs Uruk III manuscripts

\Hli{}Context -- commodity lists and lexical texts suggest
  	contrastive usage when they have distinct entries for
  	otherwise similar-looking signs

\Hli{}Transliteration Practice:
	\Hul\Hli{}CDLI-tc can be used as a control on CDLI-gh: if CDLI-tc
  	  does not differentiate variants this is an indicator that
  	  the variation is non-contrastive

\Hli{}SAG example -- CDLI-gh unmarked variants -- SAG has
  	  three forms but they are not differentially labelled in
  	  CDLI-gh because non-contrastive

\Hli{}ŠU₂ example ŠU₂: ŠU₂∼a and ŠU₂∼b marked in sign lists
  	  but not in transliteration because non-contrastive

\Hli{}KUŠU₂ example--each of the variants has instances in CDLI-tc

\Hendul


\Hendul
\Hhhh{}Compounds


\par CDLI-tc and CDLI-gh do not always differentiate compound
      constituents to the same extent as the independent versions of
      the constituents.  For example, KAR₂ is separated as KAR₂∼a and
      KAR₂∼b in CDLI-tc and CDLI-gh, but in the DARA₃×KAR₂ compounds
      the only notations that occur are |DARA₃∼c×KAR₂| and
      |DARA₃∼d×KAR₂|.  Where it is clear which version of a
      compound-constituent is present in the compound, the compound
      notation should be revised to be specific.  Where it is not
      clear, the compound notation should be left as is, following the
      CDLI perspective on contrastive/non-contrastive; it may be that
      variants are considered contrastive when used independently but
      non-contrastive when used as part of a compound.

\Hhhh{}Sequences

\Hul\Hli{}Most sequences are collections of components

\Hli{}Some sequences are opaque, i.e., the CDLI-tc/CDLI-gh sign
	name hides the fact that the sign is a sequence (e.g., ENGIZ,
	ŠAB)

\Hli{}Several classes of sequences with possibly different handling:

	\Hul\Hli{}Some sequences are reanalysis of originally integral
	  sign forms [esp city names]

\Hli{}Animal-ages are indicated by N(N57) followed by signs
   	  which in some cases are known to be animals and in others
   	  may be assumed to be based on this usage

\Hli{}Time measures where years are indicated as N(N57)+U₄,
  	  months as U₄×N(N14|N08), and days as N(N08) following an U₄
  	  notation

\Hendul


\Hli{}Ordering and placement of sequence components is highly
	variable and non-contrastive; relative positioning of elements
	in a sequence occurs because the distribution of signs in
	cases is not linear and is not an integral part of the
	structure of the sequence, e.g., |GA∼a.ZATU753|.  The
	arrangement illustrated in CDLI-gh can be effected via
	ligatures but does not need to be part of the encoding

\Hendul
\Hhh{}PC25 Principles

\Hul\Hli{}shift the basis of the encoding onto the PC corpus and
 	usage, and use the corpus as a control on the lists; use
 	the published lists and corpus as a control on CDLI-gh

\Hli{}align names with CDLI-tc/CDLI-gh as much as possible, with
	some exceptions where required to correct names or to improve
	consistency of naming scheme; if in doubt, retain CDLI
	names

\Hli{}take contrastive usage into account to the extent
   	supported by contemporary scholarship

\Hli{}do not introduce finer-grained allograph notations than
	CDLI-tc/CDLI-gh is using.  The decisions made in the corpus
	about whether sign variants are contrastive or not are made
	not only on the basis of form but also context of various
	kinds; specialists in the corpus should decide if further
	division is needed in the future

\Hli{}allograph notations are by default assumed to be
	contrastive but there are exceptions, e.g., ŠURUPPAK∼a/b/c;
	evaluate the treatment of ŠE∼a and ŠE∼a@t (90 vs 45 degrees)

\Hli{}do not assume that every sign list entry should be encoded
   	as a character

\Hli{}consider distribution of components when encoding X×Y
	versus X.Y or even Y.X; sometimes, especially for rare signs,
	it is not clear whether the juxtaposition of components is
	part of the sign structure or the distribution of individual
	elements on the manuscript. In such cases it is preferable to
	treat the signs as a sequence rather than a complex (e.g.,
	|GEŠTU∼a×ŠE∼a@t| treated as |ŠE∼a@t.GEŠTU∼a| in PCSL).

\Hli{}do not generally encode sequences; this includes sequences
	which are named in CDLI-gh and CDLI-tc as single characters
	but where the naming is an interpretive mnemonic for a sign
	group such as \code{{}ŠAB} for \code{{}|PA.IB|} and
	the like.

\Hli{}do make exceptions to sequences rule for items which are:
	\Hul\Hli{}not historically sequences but are later decomposed, i.e., city
	  names and possibly others

\Hli{}semantically integral and more convenient to
	  encode as characters, i.e., N(N57)+U₄ year notations

\Hendul


\Hli{}do not require a minimum number of occurrences for
	encoding: the corpus consists of mostly fragmentary
	manuscripts over 5000 years old--if a sign clearly exists and
	meets the other principles for encoding, it should be
	encoded

\Hli{}do not encode signs which occur only in compounds

\Hli{}do not encode uncertain signs, especially those from
	unedited texts such as the Schoyen Umma material

\Hli{}do not encode broken signs; reserve them for the PUA

\Hendul
\Hhhh{}Advantages of the Revised Approach

\Hul\Hli{}encoding better aligned with transliteration practice

\Hli{}additional glyph variants can be added without impacting
	the encoding; encoding every glyph variant would open PC to
	arbitrary open-ended encoding of slight differences with
	little basis for distinguishing when a variant should be
	encoded and when not: adopting the position that scholarly
	annotation of glyph variance as contrastive is required for
	encoding would set reasonable boundaries on what can be
	encoded and what should not be

\Hli{}new sequences can be added without impacting the
 	encoding; especially important for potentially productive
 	types N57+ANIMAL and U₄+DAY

\Hendul
\Hhhh{}Mitigations of Issues with Revised Approach

\Hul\Hli{}variant forms can be managed with font features

\Hli{}disunifications possible when further research indicates
   	them

\Hli{}unifications possible if some separately encoded
	characters are later proved to be non-contrastive

\Hendul
\Hhhh{}Reference Glyphs


\par The introduction of 1:several relationships where an
      encoded character has multiple variants entails the need for a
      principled selection of reference glyphs.


\par In order to have some level of consistency it would be
      preferable to select either Uruk IV glyphs or Uruk III glyphs
      as the primary choice of reference glyphs.  Because the corpus
      is predominantly Uruk III in date it makes sense to use Uruk
      III reference glyphs as far as possible.


\par PC25 reference glyphs are aligned where possible with Uruk
      III sign forms occurring in published texts originating from
      Uruk or Jemdet Nasr. The selection of the reference glyph is not
      necessarily an indication that the other sign forms in EASL do
      not occur in the same period or place.  It means simply that the
      reference glyph has been confirmed to occur, where possible, in
      Uruk III Uruk/Jemdet Nasr.


\par For sequences with multiple forms, the reference form is
      always the simplest/closest to the sequence description, as long
      as that form occurs in the corpus.  This means that by default
      the sign looks the way it is described, and ligatures,
      reorderings, or non-linear dispositions are always accessed by
      CVNN.


\par Important to understand that the selection of an RG does not
      imply that the form is normative--the corpus is restricted and
      sign form variation is considerable which means that the concept
      of a normative form is often inapplicable to any given sign.

\Hh{}Introduction


\par Anshuman Pandey's XXX (AP23) was responded to by Steve Tinney
      in XXX (ST24) and Pandey subsequently provided Tinney with a
      revised draft of his proposal, AP24. This draft accepted all of
      the suggestions of ST24 and included a list of 60 questions
      raised by these revisions.


\par AP24 excluded PC numerals because of an agreement that they
      would be handled in a separate proposal.  Most PC numerals were
      covered by ACN.  PC25 is focused almost exclusively on ideograms
      and includes only a few of those numerals omitted from ACN; an
      appendix on numbers provides a concordance of AP23 and ACN as
      well as notes on possible additional work required on PC
      numerals.


\par When ST24 was submitted it was already clear that a further
      step in the evolution of the PC encoding should be to align the
      proposal with the CDLI text corpus (CDLI-tc); most of the work
      done on the prposal up to that point had been carried out on the
      basis of the GitHub collection of signs CDLI-gh.


\par Partly in fulfillment of the need to ground the proposal in
      the corpus, and partly in the interests of answering Anshuman
      Panday's questions, Steve Tinney carried out further phases of
      work on the PC proposal in November/December 2024 and February
      2025.  This analysis prompted several realizations, most importantly
      the fact that while prior proposals had assumed that it was
      necessary to treat the entire sign repertoire as contrastive,
      the corpus and related published sign lists indicate that
      several hundred of the encoded characters are actually treated
      in the scholarly literature as non-contrastive.


\par In the interim, Tinney had worked on several aspects of
      Oracc's support for cuneiform fonts and on several fonts derived
      from sign lists (especially Oracc-RSP).  This experience led to
      understanding that one of the primary goals of prior proposals,
      to create an encoding which would completely support further
      scholarship on Proto-Cuneiform, could be met partly by the use
      of Font Features rather than depending only on encoding
      characters in Unicode.

\Hh{}Repertoire


\par The complete unified list of the proposed PC25 repertoire is
      \Ha{/pcsl/pc25/pc25-tab.html}{available here}.


\par The repertoire is created using the CDLI-PCSL text corpus and
      unified PCSL sign list as starting points.  Signs are removed
      from PCSL for the following reasons:

\Hol\Hli{}\bgroup\remfor{}Corpus scope:\egroup{} 
	
	signs are first removed because they do not occur in the PC25
	subcorpus.  For a list of these signs see \Ha{/pcsl/pc25/no_corpus.html}{Appendix 2}.

\Hli{}\bgroup\remfor{}Non-contrastive variants:\egroup{}

	XXX glyphs are not removed as such but do not enter into
	consideration because PC25 does not encode non-contrastive
	glyph variants.

\Hli{}\bgroup\remfor{}Ineligible Numbers:\egroup{} 
	
	signs are removed because they are numbers that are either
	encoded already in the Archaic Cuneiform Numbers proposal
	(ACN) or because PC25 does not generally include numbers
	(exceptions include the N57 and U₄-time sequences). For a list
	of these signs, excluding those in ACN, see \Ha{/pcsl/pc25/no_numberxacn.html}{Appendix 3}.

\Hli{}\bgroup\remfor{}Sequences:\egroup{} 
	
	signs are removed because they are sequences. PC25 makes no
	distinction between opaque sequences--those whose label hides
	the fact that the sign is a sequence--and simple sequences.
	PC25 does propose to encode several exceptional groups of
	sequences as described in the  section.  A
	list of excluded sequences is given in \Ha{/pcsl/pc25/no_sequence.html}{Appendix 4}.

\Hli{}\bgroup\remfor{}Broken signs:\egroup{} 
	
	are removed because they are damaged and partially incomplete.
	A list of broken signs is given in \Ha{/pcsl/pc25/no_broken.html}{Appendix 5}.

\Hli{}\bgroup\remfor{}Deleted signs:\egroup{} 
	
	signs are deleted despited surviving the preceding conditions
	because they are duplicates.  A list of deleted signs is given
	in \Ha{/pcsl/pc25/no_broken.html}{Appendix
	6}.

\Hhh{}Notes on individual classes of inclusions

\Hhhh{}Signs with non-contrastive variants


\par The 190 signs which have non-contrastive variants, with the
      proposed reference glyph in initial position in the list, is
      \Ha{../../..index.html}{given here}.

\Hhhh{}Numbers


\par Although PC25 is primarily focussed on ideograms, \Ha{../../..index.html}{some numbers, listed here}, need to be
      encoded to support N(N57) sequences.  This is a class of
      additions to AP24, which omitted all numbers.

\Hhhh{}City Names


\par A list of the signs which represent city names and are
      assigned codepoints rather than being treated as sequences is
      \Ha{../../..index.html}{given here}.

\Hh{}PC25: Sequence Exceptions

\Hhh{}Principle and Practice


\par In principle, sign list entries which are sequences of
      separate signs are not encoded in PC25. In practice, there are
      several reasons for making exceptions to this policy:

\Hdl\Hdt{}Reanalysis

{}Proto-Cuneiform signs that are originally integral units
	may be reanalyzed into separate constituents. Where this is
	demonstrably the case, the original character is encoded and
	the reanalyzed sequence is considered a glyph variant.

\Hdt{}Common Signs

{}Some signs are allowed as exceptions because it would be
	counter-intuitive not to encode them as characters.

\Hdt{}Container Equivalency

{}Some signs are allowed as exceptions because the
	juxtaposition of elements is the equivalent of a container
	(TIMES) relationship.

\Hdt{}Unencoded Constituents

{}Some sequences contain constituents that are otherwise
	unattested; in this case the choice is either to encode a sign
	which may not be attested independently, or to encode the
	sequence.  In general the option adopted is to encode the
	sequence as a character.

\Hdt{}Analogy

{}Some sequences are part of a group and would naturally be
	considered by users of the encoding to be analogous to each
	other. Where one or more members of a group fulfils either of
	the previous conditions for encoding as a character, PC25
	encodes the entire group as individual characters by analogy
	to avoid a possibly confusing mixture of encoded and unencoded
	group members.

\Henddl
\Hhh{}List of Exceptions

\Hhhh{}Reanalysis


\par Two city-name signs, ADAB and ARARMA∼a, have earlier forms
      which are distinct from their reanalysis to include an initial
      U₄ component.  Other city names may also have earlier integral
      forms but without further evidence they are not proposed for
      encoding as characters at this point.

\Hhhh{}Common Signs


\par The signs LUGAL (GAL+LU) and LI (ŠE+ŠA) are encoded as
      characters as common sign exceptions.

\Hhhh{}Container Equivalency


\par The signs ASAR and AZ are the equivalent of containers.

\Hhhh{}Unencoded Constituents


\par The following exception signs contain unencoded consituents:
      ENKUM (EZEN×ŠE), ME₃ (EŠDA-tenu), ŠAGINA (modified UŠ form with
      additional strokes, unclear with this is an UŠ or not), ZUBI∼a
      (NA₂-nutillu).

\Hhhh{}Analogy: BAPPIR Group


\par The group of signs with the base BAPPIR has one member which
      is a container (BAPPIR∼e) and the entire group is encoded by
      analogy.

\Hhhh{}Analogy: ŠELU


\par Most combinations of ŠE plus another sign are encoded as
      characters (e.g., TU) so an exception is made for ŠELU.

\Hhhh{}Analogy: Sheep Group


\par The groups of signs with the base SILANITA, UDUNITA and UTUA
      represent various types (ages, genders) of sheep and since some
      of them have unencoded constituents the members of all groups
      are encoded as characters.

\Hhhh{}Analogy: UTUL Group


\par The UTUL group contains one member which includes an uncoded
      superposed reduplicated component (UTUL∼c), so the entire group
      is encoded as characters.

\Hh{}Numbers


\par Most PC numbers have been included in a separate proposal,
      "Archaic Cuneiform Numbers" (ACN).


\par Several pages in the PCSL Sign List provide a concordance of
      ACN and PCSL and notes on numbers not included in ACN; they are
      all available from \Ha{/pcsl/signlist/ACNConcordance/}{ACN Concordance
      page}.


\par N57 numbers are proposed for inclusion in PC25.

\Hh{}Approaches


\par This page describes in an informal manner the various
      approaches that PC25 proposes to handle the PC repertoire
      represented by AP24/CDLI-gh/CDLI-tc--referred to below with the
      shorthand \code{{}AP24+}.


\par Further discussion of most of these approaches may be found
      on \Ha{https://build-oracc.museum.upenn.edu/osl/OraccCuneiformFonts/index.html}{OSL
      Unicode Cuneiform Fonts} pages.

\Hhhh{}Encoding as Unicode Characters


\par The majority of AP24+ characters should be assigned codepoints.

\Hhhh{}Font-based Support


\par OpenType font features should be used to support
      non-contrastive variants and certain combinations of characters


\par Individual variants can be included in a font as character
      variants (CVNN).


\par In addition, a stylistic set (e.g., SS04) can
      be defined to select Uruk IV variants of signs with
      non-contrastive variants.


\par Ligatures (default ligatures, \code{{}liga}) can be used
      to ensure that character sequences are displayed in a manner
      that is representative of their occurrence on manuscripts.

\Hhhh{}IVS Support


\par A common use case which involves both Uruk IV and Uruk III
      versions of signs is a table showing the development of
      cuneiform script.  In such a case, where the distinction between
      an Uruk IV and and Uruk III form is effected only via font
      features, there is the possibility for loss of essential
      information if such a table is cut and pasted from one context
      to another.


\par In order to avoid this, a set of IVS definitions can be
      provided which guarantees that an ideogram will retain the
      appropriate glyph-variant across operations such as cutting and
      pasting.

\Hhhh{}PUA Support


\par In AP23, ST24, and AP24 it is recommended that damaged
      container signs, e.g., \code{{}DUG×X} should be
      encoded. This recommendation is not ideal for three
      reasons:

\Hol\Hli{}Most importantly, X-signs have two distinct semantics: one
	class of X-signs means "there is a visible sign here but I
	don't know what it is, so I am putting 'X' to indicate that";
	another class means "there is a broken sign here so I am
	putting X because it is not clear what is there"

\Hli{}In the published lists each of these incomplete signs is
	tied to one or more instances. Later decipherment may result in
	the identification of \code{{}DUG×X} as a different
	encoded sign, in which case the encoding of the instance would
	be duplicative

\Hli{}Since a given X-sign may relate to different instances and
	these different instances may actually be partially preserved
	examples of different signs, a single X-sign may represent
	multiple possible underlying signs leading to possible false
	associations in the data

\Hendol

\par Encoding X-signs is appropriate in the first class, where
      \code{{}X} represents a clear but unidentified sign.


\par For the class of X-signs where X represents breakage, it is
      preferable to define characters in the PUA to support this
      usage; this allows the flexibility of adding multiple variants
      of X-signs for use in instances that have distinct context and
      avoids having to encode additional X-signs every time a new
      \code{{}CONTAINER×X} combination is encountered.

\Hhhh{}Sign List/Data Stream Support


\par Signs which are sequences of other signs often exhibit more
      than one ordering or selection of components, for example
      \code{{}|GA∼a.ZATU753|} also occurs as
      \code{{}|ZATU573.GA∼a|}.  In PCSL, this can be handled by
      treating both orders as forms of the same underlying sign:

\begin{verbatim}@sign |GA.ZATU753|
@oid o0900606
@form |GA∼a.ZATU753|
@oid o0900607
@@
@form |ZATU753.GA∼a|
@oid o0900608
@@
@end sign
      
@end{verbatim}

\par When the Oracc data is compiled this relationship is
      preserved in the markup in the form of a key consisting of
      \code{{}SIGN.FORM.VALUE}.  An instance of
      \code{{}|GA∼a.ZATU753|} has the key
      \code{{}`o0900606.o0900607.'} and an instance of
      \code{{}|ZATU753.GA∼a|} has the key
      \code{{}`o0900606.o0900608.'}.  (In PC the 'value' component
      is not used; in Psux it would be the transliterated reading of
      the sign, e.g., \code{{}a(LAK797)} =
      \code{{}o0000087.o0270203.a}).


\par Both the individual sign forms and the fact that the forms
      are the "same sign" are preserved in this notation which can
      then be the basis for further processing either retaining or
      ignoring the differentiation as desired.
