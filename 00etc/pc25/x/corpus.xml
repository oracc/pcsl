      <p>The PC text Corpus is defined by the CDLI corpus of
      Proto-Cuneiform texts of Uruk IV and Uruk III data, as adapted
      for use by PCSL: we call this <code>CDLI-tc</code>. There are
      5976 texts in the corpus of which 1752 are attributed to Uruk IV
      and 4224, or roughly 75% of the corpus, to the subsequent Uruk
      III period.</p>
      <p>The digital corpus consists of the following major groups:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Uruk lexical tablets from ATU3 (Uruk IV and Uruk III)</li>
	<li>Uruk administrative tablets from ATU5, ATU6, ATU7 (Uruk IV and Uruk III);
	these supercede ATU1</li>
	<li>Jemdet Nasr (Uruk III) tablets from MSVO1; these supercede
	Langdon, PI</li>
	<li>Tablets from various locations from MSVO4; this includes
	non-Uruk tablets which were included in ATU1</li>
	<li>Tablets in private collections from various locations in
	CUSAS1, CUSAS21, and CUSAS31; these post-date the ATU and MSVO
	volumes</li>
	<li>Tablets from the "Erlenmeyer Collection"; these were to be
	published in MSVO3 which has not yet appeared; many of them
	have been edited by Englund and others in various
	publications, however</li>
	<li>Tablets in private collections primarily from Umma; these
	are in the CDLI set of transliterations but have not yet been
	edited in print</li>
      </ul>
